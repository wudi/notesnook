# Organizing notes with notebooks

Notebooks are a quick and easy way for nested organization of notes.

In Notesnook, one note can belong to multiple notebooks. This allows for very flexible organization structures. For example, an author can "link" the character list to all the chapters instead of duplicating it for each chapter. Similarly, a user can link common notes between multiple notebooks without any duplication.
